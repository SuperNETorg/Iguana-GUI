#Iguana is an app helping people and companies to have new age financial tools, based on crypto- and blockchain-technologies.

The application works on the unique Iguana core, which functions as a simple daemon, but provides a wide platform for all cryptocurrencies, peer-to-peer financial tools and desentralised applications (DAPPs). 

The app also may serve as a monocoin-wallet (Non-Iguana mode) with well-designed graphic interface and give a better experience then command line wallets for many altcoins or bitcoin wallets popular in the market. Though running a Non-Iguana monocoin wallet requires the following depences to be met:

###Dependencies for Non-Iguana mode###

3) Proxy server is set up,
